## Last Week's Accomplishments

We created a template for the application, which runs the client and the server with our desired technologies.

We talked about what we wanted our application to be able to do, along with a simple discussion of site mapes

We also talked about the possibility of combining projects with another group in our small group since it is very similar. We ended up deciding to reduce our team's projects scope and have our two teams work alongside each other in kinda like sister apps.


## This Week's Plan


We also need to add the react router and set up a state manager for our application.

We need to draw mockups and wireframes of our application as well

figure out how to distrubute work between group members


## Anything Blocking?

having a group member drop the class is a very big blocker, but they may not actually drop. We're figuring it out.
