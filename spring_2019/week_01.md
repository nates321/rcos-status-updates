## Last Week's Accomplishments

We created a template for the application, which runs the client and the server with our desired technologies.

We talked about what we wanted our application to be able to do, along with a simple discussion of site mapes

We also talked about the possibility of combining projects with another group in our small group since it is very similar

## This Week's Plan

This week we need to finalise what we are doing (combining groups or not)

We also need to add the react router and set up a state manager for our application.

We need to draw mockups and wireframes of our application as well

## Anything Blocking?

Talking to the other group is blocking progress, after talking to them we will be able to move forward
